# M-TUBE
### POWER BY : MOSTAKIM LAB'S

A production-ready Next.js (App Router) media downloader powered by `@media-downloaders/v2`. It keeps the original M-TUBE query-parameter UI and connects it to real, validated `/api/info` and `/api/download` routes.

## Features

- Query-parameter routing (`/~`, `/?download`, `/?api`, …) — no subdomains, no extra physical routes
- No login, no accounts, no database — history/settings live in `localStorage`
- No user API keys — the public API is scoped to whatever domain it's deployed on
- Zod-validated, SSRF-protected, rate-limited API routes
- Real downloader output is streamed through a short-lived server-side job URL
- Downloader files are temporary and are never faked or replaced with placeholder URLs
- Fixed light theme, responsive mobile-first UI preserving the original M-TUBE design
- Deployable to Vercel with zero extra infrastructure

## Tech stack

Next.js 15 (App Router) · React 18 · Zod · `@media-downloaders/v2` · plain CSS — no database or login system.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000/~`.

`index.js` uses port `5000` by default and honors `process.env.PORT` when it is set.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev     # local development
npm run build   # production build
npm run start   # run the production build
npm run lint    # eslint
```

## Environment variables

The app runs without a database or login configuration. Optional variables are listed in `.env.example`.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MTUBE_YOUTUBE_COOKIE` | Optional server-only YouTube cookie, if the source requires authentication |
| `MTUBE_YOUTUBE_MAX_DURATION` | Maximum YouTube duration in seconds; defaults to `1800` |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` / `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` | API rate limit tuning |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_*` | Support page contact links |

## Routing

No subdomains, no nested physical routes for the app pages. A single root route (`app/page.js`) reads `searchParams` and renders the matching page component; the canonical home route is `app/~/page.js`.

| URL | Page |
|---|---|
| `/~` | Home |
| `/?download` | Download |
| `/?downloads` | Downloads |
| `/?finished` | Finished |
| `/?settings` | Settings |
| `/?api` | API docs |
| `/?support` | Support |
| `/?terms` | Terms & Conditions |
| `/?privacy` | Privacy Policy |
| `/` (no query) | Redirects to `/~` |
| `/` with an unrecognized query | Renders Home inline |

Because these are real URLs handled by Next.js's router, browser back/forward and refresh all work natively — no custom history hacking required.

## API documentation

Base URL is derived from the current origin at request time — never hard-coded. See it live at `/?api`, or:

**POST `/api/info`**
```json
{ "url": "https://example.com/video" }
```
Response for a supported URL:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "provider": "@media-downloaders/v2",
  "platform": "TikTok",
  "title": "media",
  "formats": [
    { "type": "video", "quality": "original", "container": "mp4" }
  ]
}
```

**POST `/api/download`**
```json
{ "url": "https://example.com/video", "format": "mp4", "quality": "720p" }
```

`POST /api/download` downloads the source using `@media-downloaders/v2`, stores the verified non-empty result in a temporary server directory, and returns a real `download_url`. `GET /api/download?jobId=...` streams that file. Jobs expire automatically.

**GET `/api/status/[jobId]`** — reports the real temporary download job state and size while the file is available.

No API key is required for any endpoint. Rate limiting and SSRF protection apply to all of them regardless.

## Downloader architecture

`lib/downloader.js` is the only application adapter around `@media-downloaders/v2`. The adapter:

- uses the package's real downloader for supported URLs;
- serializes calls because the package writes temporary files in the process directory;
- checks that the returned path is an expected non-empty file;
- moves the verified file into an isolated temporary directory;
- exposes only an unguessable, expiring job URL to the browser.

The `/api/info` response reports the actual formats this backend can produce: the package currently returns an original-quality MP4 file. The app does not claim unsupported audio conversion, quality conversion, progress, or metadata that the package did not provide.

## Security

- **Validation:** every request body is parsed against a Zod schema (`lib/validation.js`) before anything else runs.
- **SSRF protection:** `lib/security.js` rejects `file://`, non-http(s) protocols, `localhost`, loopback/private IP ranges, and cloud metadata addresses before a URL ever reaches a provider.
- **Rate limiting:** `lib/rateLimit.js` is a best-effort, in-memory, per-IP limiter (see the note in that file about swapping in a durable store like Upstash Redis for strict cross-instance limits in production).
- **Safe errors:** unexpected errors are logged server-side only; the client always gets a generic, safe message (`lib/security.js#toSafeErrorResponse`).
- **Secrets:** provider credentials live only in environment variables, read only in server-side route/provider code. Nothing under `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` holds a secret.
- **No anti-DevTools tricks:** production hardening is standard Next.js minification/no-sourcemaps plus a few response headers (`next.config.js`) — not right-click/F12 blockers, which don't actually protect anything.

## Local storage

`lib/storage.js` wraps `localStorage` for settings, active downloads, and finished downloads. Nothing here is ever sent to a server. Users can clear it from `/?settings`.

## Branding / logo

Replace `public/m.tube.lite.png` with your real asset (same filename) — the `Logo` component (`components/Logo.jsx`) falls back to an inline SVG mark automatically if the file is missing, so the UI never shows a broken image either way.

## Deploying to Vercel

The repository includes `vercel.json` with the npm install and Next.js build settings.

1. Push this repository to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
2. Import it into Vercel — the Next.js framework is configured automatically.
3. Add any variables from `.env.example` in the Vercel project settings.
4. Deploy. No database, no VPS, no custom server required.

## Deploying to Render

The repository includes `render.yaml` for a Render Web Service.

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In Render, choose **New → Blueprint** and select the repository.
3. Render runs `npm install && npm run build`, then starts `npm run start`.
4. Add `MTUBE_YOUTUBE_COOKIE` only if the downloader needs it for the source being used.

Render supplies `PORT` automatically; `index.js` honors it. The `/~` route is configured as the health check.

## Known limitations

- `@media-downloaders/v2` may require a valid `MTUBE_YOUTUBE_COOKIE` for some YouTube links.
- Rate limiting is per-warm-instance, not globally atomic, without adding a durable store.
- Temporary download jobs are in-memory and expire when the server restarts or their TTL elapses.
- No automated tests are included in this scaffold.

## Legal / usage note

M-TUBE is a tool for downloading content you have permission to download and use. It does not host, store, or distribute any third-party content itself, and it is not designed to bypass authentication, DRM, paywalls, or access controls.
